#MetaphorJs UI

v.0.1

MetaphorJs UI is a Javascript UI library similar to ExtJs with support of
AngularJs/Vue declarative templates.

The goal of this framework is the opposite of what css frameworks like Bootstrap do.
Powered by MetaphorJs, it aims to make UI functionality markup-agnostic.

Bootstrap, SemanticUI and others have their own javascript libraries powering up
components like dropdowns, dialogs, form validation, etc.
If you want to switch from one to another, you also have to replace javascript
part of it and re-connect to it. This is due to difference in markup, class naming, etc.

With MetaphorJs UI the main logic stays in component, while you set it to use
different template. (The templates will be provided as separate packages).
You can also write your own if you want.
